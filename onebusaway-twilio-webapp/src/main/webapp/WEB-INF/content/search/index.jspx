      Note that this menu item has changed.  Listen further for more instructions or skip ahead by entering the number of a route servicing your stop, followed by the pound sign.  When navigating the set of stops for a route, you can move back and forward with the 4 and 6 keys, or skip back and forward even further with the 7 and 9 keys.
