## The OneBusAway Application Suite [![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/actions/workflows/maven.yml) [Join the OneBusAway chat](https://onebusaway.slack.com/)

A project of the non-profit [Open Transit Software Foundation](https://opentransitsoftwarefoundation.org/)!

The OneBusAway application suite's primary function is to share real-time public transit information with riders across a variety of interfaces:

  * [Wayfinder](https://github.com/onebusAway/wayfinder) - A high-performance web application built with with the SvelteKit JavaScript web app framework
  * [OneBusAway Web](http://pugetsound.onebusaway.org/) - A variety of web interfaces to transit data
    * A standard web interface to transit data, including maps and stop pages with real-time info
    * [Sign-mode](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/Sign-Mode) - Same information as the standard web interface, but in a large format for large displays (e.g., large televisions)
    * A mobile-optimized version of the web interface for smart phone mobile browsers
    * A text-only version of the web interface for more-basic mobile browsers
  * [OneBusAway REST API]( https://developer.onebusaway.org/api/where) - A RESTful web-service that can be used to quickly write applications built on top of transit data. This API powers the following apps:
    * [OneBusAway iOS (iPhone)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-ios)
    * [OneBusAway Android](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android)
    * [OneBusAway Alexa (for Amazon Echo, etc.)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-alexa)
  * [OneBusAway GTFS-realtime export](http://developer.onebusaway.org/modules/onebusaway-application-modules/current-SNAPSHOT/api/gtfs-realtime.html) - A bulk export of all trip updates (predictions), vehicle positions, and service alerts for a transit system in the [GTFS-realtime format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/).
  * [OneBusAway Watchdog](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/OneBusAway-Watchdog) - A module hosting webservices for monitoring realtime data

## Getting Started

Here are the high-level steps you'll need to take to launch the OneBusAway mobile apps in your area:

1. Get your schedule transit data in the [GTFS format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)
2. Have an AVL system that produces arrival estimates (*Note: we're working removing this requirement - [contact us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/onebusaway-developers) if you're interested.  Alternatively, you may be able to use other open-source projects, such as [The Transit Clock](https://thetransitclock.github.io), to go directly from raw vehicle locations to arrival times that are shared via GTFS-realtime and SIRI - this would replace Steps 2 and 3.*)
3. Implement a [GTFS-realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) or [SIRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Interface_for_Real_Time_Information) real-time data feed *(We also support [other formats](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/Real-Time-Data-Configuration-Guide))*
4. Set up [a OneBusAway server](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules#setting-up-a-onebusaway-server)
5. Do some quality-control testing of arrival times
6. Request to be added as a OneBusAway region

See the [multi-region page](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki/Multi-Region) for more details.

#### Setting up a OneBusAway server

There are two options for setting up your own OneBusAway instance:
* [Configuration and Deployment Guide for v2.x](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki/Configuration-and-Deployment-Guide-for-v2.x) - Designed to provide a comprehensive deployment method for users who wish to set up a simple OneBusAway application with minimal configurations.
* [onebusaway-docker (Under development)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-docker) - A community-supported Docker configuration for OneBusAway v2.x is currently under development.

## Development Instructions with Docker

```sh
docker compose up builder

# Now, open another window or tab and continue running commands:

# acquaint yourself with the make options
bin/make --help 

# build the project
bin/make

# now you have built all of the OBA artifacts, which can be found in the `/root/.m2/repository` directory.

# enter the docker container and look around
bin/shell 
ls /root/.m2/repository # this runs inside the docker container

# exit the docker container
exit 

# Build a data bundle, which will power the OBA server:
bin/build_bundle

# Finally, copy all of the built WAR resources into /usr/local/tomcat
bin/copy_and_relaunch

# wait a few seconds for everything to spin up...
```

Finally, verify that everything works as expected!

* Check out the Tomcat Web App Manager at http://localhost:8080/manager/html (user/pass: admin/admin) to verify that your OBA WARs deployed correctly
* Check out the config.json API endpoint to verify that everything built correctly: http://localhost:8080/onebusaway-api-webapp/api/where/config.json?key=test
* If the server isn't loading, Ctrl+C the Docker container to terminate it, then relaunch it, and everything should work fine.

## GTFS Data

**Be sure to rebuild the Docker image if you change any of these settings!**

By default, the development server is configured to use static and real-time data from the Seattle area transit agency, King County Metro. To change this default to fit your development, testing, or debugging needs, change the following settings:

* `./Dockerfile` - Change `GTFS_URL` to your static GTFS URL: `GTFS_URL="https://www.soundtransit.org/GTFS-KCM/google_transit.zip"` (or modify it in the docker-compose.yml file).
* `./docker_app_server/config/onebusaway-transit-data-federation-webapp-data-sources.xml` - change the following properties...
  * `tripUpdatesUrl`
  * `vehiclePositionsUrl`
  * `alertsUrl`
  * `agencyId`

**Note**: if the GTFS-RT feeds require a header-supplied API key, also modify the `headersMap` property thusly:

```
<property name="headersMap">
  <map>
    <entry key="{API KEY PROPERTY NAME}" value="{API KEY PROPERTY VALUE}" />
  </map>
</property>
```

for example:

```
<property name="headersMap">
  <map>
    <entry key="X-API-KEY" value="12345" />
  </map>
</property>
```

## Debugging

### VSCode

0. Make sure that you have completed all of the earlier steps and that this endpoint loads in your browser: `http://localhost:8080/onebusaway-api-webapp/api/where/config.json?key=test`
1. Install these extensions:
  * [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)
  * [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
2. Set breakpoints in the code file that you want to debug. If you're just getting started, we recommend that you set a breakpoint in `onebusaway-api-webapp/src/main/java/org/onebusaway/api/actions/api/where/ConfigAction.java` in the `index()` method. 
3. Open the Run and Debug tab in VSCode, make sure that the debug target dropdown lists `Debug (Attach)`.
4. Click the Start Debugging button.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to the API action where you have set a breakpoint. If you have set a breakpoint in ConfigAction.java, navigate to http://localhost:8080/onebusaway-api-webapp/api/where/config.json?key=test

## Download

* [Latest Stable Release](https://developer.onebusaway.org/downloads)

## Build and Deploy OBA Artifacts to Maven Central

1. Set up your environment, including GPG
   * [Maven Central documentation](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/)
   * [Some helpful information elided by Sonatype](https://www.swissarmyronin.dk/Miscellaneous/Gpg-maven/)
2. Run the command `mvn deploy -DskipTests`
3. Upload the Zip file at `./target/central-publishing/central-bundle.zip` to [Maven Central's publishing page](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments).
    * The Zip file is about 600MB in size. Be sure to have a fast, reliable connection. 

Open questions and issues:

* I haven't figured out why I cannot get the `mvn deploy` command to upload to Maven Central automatically.
* We need to automate deployment to Maven Central via GitHub Actions eventually, too.
