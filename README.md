## The OneBusAway Application Suite [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules) [![Join the OneBusAway chat](https://onebusaway.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://onebusaway.herokuapp.com/)

The OneBusAway application suite's primary function is to share real-time public transit information with riders across a variety of interfaces:

  * [OneBusAway Web](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/OneBusAway-Web) - A variety of web interfaces to transit data
    * A standard web interface to transit data, including maps and stop pages with real-time info
    * [Sign-mode](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/Sign-Mode) - Same information as the standard web interface, but in a large format for large displays (e.g., large televisions)
    * A mobile-optimized version of the web interface for smart phone mobile browsers
    * A text-only version of the web interface for more-basic mobile browsers
  * [OneBusAway REST API](http://developer.onebusaway.org/modules/onebusaway-application-modules/current/api/where/index.html) - A RESTful web-service that can be used to quickly write applications built on top of transit data. This API powers the following apps:
    * [OneBusAway iOS (iPhone)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-iphone)
    * [OneBusAway Android](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android)
    * [OneBusAway Windows Phone](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-windows-phone)
    * [OneBusAway Windows 8](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-windows8)
    * [OneBusAway Windows 10 (under development)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-windows10)
    * [OneBusAway Fire Phone (based on Android)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android)
    * [OneBusAway Alexa (for Amazon Echo, etc.)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-alexa)
    * [OneBusAway Glassware (for Google Glass)](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/pull/219)
    * [OneBusAway for Pebble Smartwatch](https://github.com/onebusaway/onebusaway-pebbletime)
  * [OneBusAway GTFS-realtime export](http://developer.onebusaway.org/modules/onebusaway-application-modules/current-SNAPSHOT/api/gtfs-realtime.html) - A bulk export of all trip updates (predictions), vehicle positions, and service alerts for a transit system in the [GTFS-realtime format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/).
  * [OneBusAway Phone](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/OneBusAway-Phone-and-SMS) - A Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone application for accessing real-time transit information
  * [OneBusAway SMS](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/OneBusAway-Phone-and-SMS) - An SMS service for accessing real-time transit information
  * [OneBusAway Watchdog](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/OneBusAway-Watchdog) - A module hosting webservices for monitoring realtime data

## Getting Started

Here are the high-level steps you'll need to take to launch the OneBusAway mobile apps in your area:

1. Get your schedule transit data in the [GTFS format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)
2. Have an AVL system that produces arrival estimates (*Note: we're working removing this requirement - [contact us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/onebusaway-developers) if you're interested.  Alternatively, you may be able to use other open-source projects, such as [TransiTime](https://github.com/Transitime/core/wiki), to go directly from raw vehicle locations to arrival times that are shared via GTFS-realtime and SIRI - this would replace Steps 2 and 3.*)
3. Implement a [GTFS-realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) or [SIRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Interface_for_Real_Time_Information) real-time data feed *(We also support [other formats](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/Real-Time-Data-Configuration-Guide))*
4. Set up [a OneBusAway server](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules#setting-up-a-onebusaway-server)
5. Do some quality-control testing of arrival times
6. Request to be added as a OneBusAway region

See the [multi-region page](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki/Multi-Region) for more details.

#### Setting up a OneBusAway server

There are two options for setting up your own OneBusAway instance:
* [Quick-Start Guide](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/OneBusAway-Quickstart-Guide) - We provide a Quick-Start bundle designed to get you up and running quickly with OneBusAway.
* [Developer Installation Guide](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/Developer-Guide) - If you want to get your hands dirty with code, this guide will help you get a OneBusAway instance set up using the source-code and Eclipse.
