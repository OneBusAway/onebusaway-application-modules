$H$H 1.0.6

* New Features:
    * Add [@ConfigurationParameter](apidocs/org/onebusaway/container/ConfigurationParameter.html) annotation for marking

      [documentation](oba-configs/index.html) for these parameters.
    * Make the Google Maps API key a configurable parameter: `defaultWebappConfigurationSource.googleMapsApiKey`
    * Allow such bean properties to be overriden from the command-line for the webapp quickstart with the same
      -PbeanName.propertyName=value syntax used in the bundle builder command-line app.
    * Add more content to the trip problem report page to make it easier to diagnose problems.
    * Add a number of method for managing stale user accounts.
      [commit](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/commit/5fccc28658da7e2290ebf98c476d84fc655a1f51)  
* Bug Fixes:
    * A number of fixes for Trip and Stop Problem reporting to handle the situation when a report refers to a stop or
      trip that is no longer loaded in the transit bundle. 
    * Upgrade to struts 2.2.3.1, which hides those annoying GWT class exceptions on webapp startup.
    * ConfigurationService config cache was not properly reset on application startup.
    * In the VehicleLocationRecords API Action, the `vehicleId`, `fromTime`, and `toTime` parameters were not being
      properly set for the action.
      [commit](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/commit/826b4bba2a67ec28f682b6431bd5965cd34fbe10)
    * Make sure vehicleId is properly set when creating a TripProblemReportBean from a DB record.

$H$H 1.0.5

* Better computation of agency coverage area, using the actual routes > trips > stops to compute coverage.
* Better display of agencies on agency map, expanding map to show agency bounds in addition to agency center point.
* Bug fixes for quick-start webapp, mostly to deal with quirks of embedded Jetty webapp container.
* Add 404 page-not-found behavior to the root onebusaway-webapp index action, since it's called by default if another
  action can't be found for a URL.
* Refactor ConfigurationService to accept the webapp context-path as a parameter.  Attempting to detect the
  context-path automatically was proving to be a bit messy under different containers.
* Change how dynamic namespace matching works for the wiki (/p/*) action. The new name-based matching method doesn't
  require direct access to the underlying Struts ActionProxy and also gets rid of a ton of annoying log messages when
  running under Jetty.
* Add a configuration parameter to disable location interpolation in the BlockLocationServiceImpl.
* Remove a number of unused dependencies to get the size of release binaries down a bit.
