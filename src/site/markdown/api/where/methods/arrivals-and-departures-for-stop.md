## Request Parameters

* id - the stop id, encoded directly in the url:
    * `http://api.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/api/where/arrivals-and-departures-for-stop/[ID GOES HERE].xml`
* minutesBefore=n - include vehicles having arrived or departed in the previous n minutes (default=5)
* minutesAfter=n - include vehicles arriving or departing in the next n minutes (default=35)
* time - by default, the method returns the status of the system right now.  However, the system
  can also be queried at a specific time.  This can be useful for testing.  See [timestamps](../index.html#Timestamps)
  for details on the format of the `time` parameter.


## Response

The response is primarily composed of [`<arrivalAndDeparture/>` elements](../elements/arrival-and-departure.html),  so see the element documentation for specific details.

The nearby stop list is designed to capture stops that are very close by (like across the street) for quick navigation.
