## Request Parameters

* lat - The latitude coordinate of the search center
* lon - The longitude coordinate of the search center
* latSpan/lonSpan - Set the limits of the search bounding box
* includeTrips - Can be true/false to determine whether full [`<trip/>` elements](../elements/trip.html) are included in the `<references/>` section.  Defaults to false.
* includeSchedules - Can be true/false to determine whether full `<schedule/>` elements are included in the `<tripDetails/>` section.  Defaults to false.
* time - by default, the method returns the status of the system right now.  However, the system
  can also be queried at a specific time.  This can be useful for testing.  See [timestamps](../index.html#Timestamps)
  for details on the format of the `time` parameter.

## Response

The response is a list of
[`<tripDetails/>` element](../elements/trip-details.html) that captures extended
details about each active trip.  Active trips are ones where the transit vehicle
is currently located within the search radius.  We use real-time arrival data to
determine the position of transit vehicles when available, otherwise we
determine the location of vehicles from the static schedule.
