## Request Parameters

* id - the id of the route, encoded directly in the url:
    * `http://api.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/api/where/trips-for-route/[ID GOES HERE].xml`
* includeStatus - Can be true/false to determine whether full
  [`<tripStatus/>` elements](../elements/trip-status.html) with full real-time
  information are included in the `<status/>` section for each `<tripDetails/>`
  element.  Defaults to false.
* includeSchedules - Can be true/false to determine whether full `<schedule/>`
  elements are included in the `<tripDetails/>` element.  Defaults to false.
* time - by default, the method returns the status of the system right now.  However, the system
  can also be queried at a specific time.  This can be useful for testing.  See [timestamps](../index.html#Timestamps)
  for details on the format of the `time` parameter.

## Response

The response is a list of
[`<tripDetails/>` element](../elements/trip-details.html) that captures extended
details about each active trip.  The set of active trips includes any trip that
serves that specified route that is currently active.
